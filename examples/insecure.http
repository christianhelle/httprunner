# Example demonstrating insecure HTTPS connections
# This allows connecting to HTTPS endpoints with self-signed certificates
# or other SSL certificate verification issues

# Example 1: Connect to a self-signed HTTPS endpoint
# INSECURE
GET https://self-signed.badssl.com/

###

# Example 2: Connect to an expired certificate endpoint
# INSECURE
GET https://expired.badssl.com/

###

# Example 3: Connect to an untrusted root certificate endpoint
INSECURE
GET https://untrusted-root.badssl.com/

###

# Example 4: POST request to insecure endpoint with body
# INSECURE
POST https://self-signed.badssl.com/api/test
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "test": "data"
}

###

# Example 5: Regular secure HTTPS (for comparison - this should work normally)
GET https://example.com/
